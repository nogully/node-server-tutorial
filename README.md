## Simple Node Server

### What type of information is included in the header of a request?
- CRUD method 
- accept
- content-type

### What are the major RESTful methods and what do each of them do?
- 'GET': default method, needs no body, receives response identified by request
- 'POST': create a new resource
- 'PUT': fully update a new resource
- 'PATCH': update a portion of a specific resource
- 'DELETE': destroy a resource on the server, delete resource identified by request

### What is Node?
- Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be run server-side. It's fast, single-threaded, and non-blocking, but still async like JavaScript. Node took advantage of the V8 engine, something Google Chrome developed in C++ and subsequently open-sourced. This compiles JavaScript into native machine code, hence the speed.
